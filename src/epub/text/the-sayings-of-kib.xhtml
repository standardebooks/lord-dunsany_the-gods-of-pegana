			</h2>
			<p>Kib said: “I am Kib. I am none other than Kib.”</p>
			<p>Kib is Kib. Kib is he and no other. Believe! Kib said: “When Time was early, when Time was very early indeed⁠—there was only <b>Māna-Yood-Sushāī</b>. <b>Māna-Yood-Sushāī</b> was before the beginning of the gods, and shall be after their going.”</p>
			<p>And Kib said: “After the going of the gods there will be no small worlds nor big.”</p>
			<p>Kib said: “It will be lonely for <b>Māna-Yood-Sushāī</b>.”</p>
			<p>Because this is written, <em>believe</em>! For is it not written, or are you greater than Kib? Kib is Kib.</p>
